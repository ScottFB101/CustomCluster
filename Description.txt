Description:

The abstract clustering algorithm starts by taking a random observation from a data set, and a 
designated distance from the user, then forms clusters by finding points within the designated distance
from the random observation. After forming the first cluster, the algorithm continues to repeat this
process until every observation in the data set has a assigned cluster.
